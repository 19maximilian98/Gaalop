The versioning scheme for packages consists of four numbers separated by a dot.

Definitions:
Packages are here defined as archives for release on the homepage or otherwise.
A subpackage is hereby defined as a "Maven module".
The interface of a subpackage are all those "Java classes and interfaces" that are directly accessed from other subpackages other than its own subpackage.

Rules:
The least significant digit is the SVN revision number.

The third most significant digit is counted up on every minor change or bugfix, which does not change any interfaces of a subpackage.

The second most significant digit is counted up on every change of the interface of a subpackage. Counting it up resets the third most significant digit to 0.

The most significant digit is counted up on major architecture changes of the whole package. Counting it up resets all other digits to 0 except the revision number.

Example:
1.2.4.r1022

means Revision 1022, has had 4 bugfixes or minor changes since the last interface change, of which it had 2.
The product is currently in its first major version.
